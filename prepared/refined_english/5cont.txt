93. Socles, the representative from Corinth, spoke these words, and Hippias responded by calling upon the same gods that Socles had invoked as witnesses. Hippias said that the Corinthians would be the first to want the Pisistratidae back when the time came for them to be troubled by the Athenians. Hippias made this statement because he had a better understanding of the oracles than anyone else. Hearing Socles' bold words, the rest of the allies, who had been silent until now, spoke up and agreed with the Corinthians. They pleaded with the Lacedaemonians not to harm a Greek city. 
94. Hippias' plan failed, and he was forced to leave. Amyntas, the king of the Macedonians, offered him Anthemus, and the Thessalians offered Iolcus, but he refused both. Instead, he went to Sigeum, which Pisistratus had taken from the Mytilenaeans and where he had placed Hegesistratus, his illegitimate son with an Argive woman, as the ruler. However, Hegesistratus couldn't maintain control of what Pisistratus had given him without fighting, as there was a long-lasting war between the Athenians at Sigeum and the Mytilenaeans at Achilleum. The Mytilenaeans wanted the place back, but the Athenians argued that the Aeolians had no more claim to the land of Ilium than they or any other Greeks who had helped Menelaus avenge Helen's abduction, and they refused to give it up. 
95. During this war, one particular event stands out. In a battle where the Athenians were winning, the poet Alcaeus fled and escaped, but his armor was captured by the Athenians and displayed in the temple of Athena at Sigeum. Alcaeus wrote a poem about this incident and sent it to Mytilene, telling his friend Melanippus about his misfortune. As for the Mytilenaeans and Athenians, they eventually made peace through the mediation of Periander, son of Cypselus, who they agreed to let decide the matter. The terms of the peace were that each side would keep what they had. 
96. Sigeum eventually came under Athenian control. Meanwhile, Hippias went to Asia from Lacedaemon and tried his best to persuade Artaphrenes to help him and Darius take over Athens by speaking ill of the Athenians. When the Athenians found out about this, they sent messengers to Sardis, warning the Persians not to trust exiled Athenians. However, Artaphrenes told them to accept Hippias back if they wanted to be safe. The Athenians refused this proposal, and as a result, they decided to openly declare war against Persia. 
97. When the Athenians decided to oppose Persia and were on bad terms with them, Aristagoras from Miletus, who had been rejected by Cleomenes of Sparta, came to Athens, as it was the most powerful city. He spoke to the people about the riches of Asia and how the Persians, who didn't use shields or spears in battle, could be easily defeated. He also mentioned that the Milesians were originally from Athens and that it was their duty to help them. Aristagoras made many promises in his passionate plea, eventually convincing the Athenians. It seems that it's easier to deceive many people than just one, as Aristagoras couldn't deceive Cleomenes of Sparta, but he managed to deceive thirty thousand Athenians. Persuaded, the Athenians voted to send twenty ships to help the Ionians, with Melanthius, a respected Athenian citizen, as their admiral. These ships marked the beginning of troubles for both Greeks and foreigners. 
98. Aristagoras arrived in Miletus before the others and came up with a plan that wouldn't benefit the Ionians but would annoy King Darius. He sent a man to Phrygia, where the Paeonians, who had been captured by Megabazus and forced to live in a separate village, were staying. The man told the Paeonians that Aristagoras, the ruler of Miletus, had a plan for their escape if they were willing to follow it. Since all of Ionia was rebelling against the king, they could return to their homeland, and they would be taken care of afterward. The Paeonians were happy to hear this news, and although some stayed behind out of fear, the rest gathered their families and fled to the sea. They crossed over to Chios, but a large group of Persian horsemen pursued them. Unable to catch up, the Persians sent a message to Chios, ordering the Paeonians to return. The Paeonians refused and were taken from Chios to Lesbos by the Chians, and then from Lesbos to Doriscus by the Lesbians. From there, they traveled by land back to Paeonia. 
99. The Athenians arrived with their twenty ships, along with five triremes from the Eretrians, who joined the war not to please the Athenians but to repay a debt to the Milesians. This was because the Milesians had once helped the Eretrians in a war against Chalcis, when the Samians had supported the Chalcidians against the Eretrians and Milesians. When the Athenians, Eretrians, and other allies arrived, Aristagoras planned an attack on Sardis. However, he stayed in Miletus and appointed two generals to lead the Milesian army: his brother Charopinus and another citizen named Hermophantus. 
100. When the Ionians arrived in Ephesus with their army, they left their ships at Coresus, which was in Ephesian territory. They then marched inland, guided by Ephesians, and followed the Caicus River. After crossing the Tmolus mountain, they reached Sardis and captured it easily, facing no resistance. The only part they didn't take was the citadel, which was defended by Artaphrenes and a large number of soldiers. 
101. The Ionians couldn't loot the city because most of the houses in Sardis were made of reeds, and even the brick houses had reed roofs. When a soldier accidentally set one house on fire, the flames quickly spread throughout the entire city. As the city burned, the Lydians and Persians trapped in the citadel had no way out, since the fire was consuming the outer parts of the city. They gathered in the marketplace and near the river Pactolus, which flowed through the marketplace, carrying gold dust from the Tmolus mountain and eventually joining the Hermus River before reaching the sea. The Lydians and Persians were forced to defend themselves in the marketplace. When the Ionians saw their enemies fighting back and a large number of others approaching, they became scared and retreated to the Tmolus mountain. At nightfall, they left the mountain and returned to their ships. 
102. During the fire in Sardis, a temple dedicated to Cybebe, the local goddess, was destroyed. The Persians later used this as an excuse to burn the temples in Hellas. Meanwhile, the Persians from the provinces near the Halys River heard about the situation and came to help the Lydians. They arrived after the Ionians had already left Sardis, but they managed to catch up with them at Ephesus. A battle took place in Ephesus, where the Ionians were completely defeated. The Persians killed many notable men, including Eualcides, the general of the Eretrians, who had been a champion in the games and highly praised by the poet Simonides of Ceos. The surviving Ionians fled the battle and returned to their respective cities. 
103. The battle ended with the Ionians suffering great losses. After this, the Athenians decided to completely separate themselves from the Ionians and refused to help them, even though Aristagoras sent urgent messages asking for assistance. Despite losing their Athenian allies, the Ionians remained determined to continue their fight against King Darius, as they were already deeply committed to the cause. The Ionians sailed to the Hellespont and managed to take control of Byzantium and all the other cities in the region. Then, they sailed out from the Hellespont and gained the support of most of Caria. Even the city of Caunus, which had previously refused to join the Ionians, decided to ally with them after the burning of Sardis. 
104. The people of Cyprus also decided to join the rebellion against the Medes, except for the people of Amathus. The reason for this revolt was as follows: Onesilus, the younger brother of Gorgus, the king of Salamis, had always encouraged Gorgus to rebel against Darius. When he heard that the Ionians had revolted, he became even more insistent. However, Gorgus remained unconvinced. Taking advantage of Gorgus's absence from the city of Salamis, Onesilus and his supporters closed the city gates, effectively locking Gorgus out. Gorgus, having lost his city, sought refuge with the Medes. Onesilus then became the king of Salamis and managed to persuade all of Cyprus to join the revolt, except for the Amathusians, who refused to participate. As a result, Onesilus gathered his forces and laid siege to the city of Amathus. 
105. Onesilus continued to besiege Amathus. When Darius heard that Sardis had been captured and burned by the Athenians and Ionians, and that Aristagoras of Miletus had led the plot, he initially didn't pay much attention to the Ionians, believing they would eventually be punished for their rebellion. However, he did ask who the Athenians were. After getting an answer, he grabbed his bow, placed an arrow on it, and shot it into the sky, praying to Zeus, "Please, let me take revenge on the Athenians." Then, he instructed one of his servants to remind him three times during each meal, "Master, don't forget about the Athenians." 
106. After giving his order, Darius summoned Histiaeus, the Milesian who had been with him for a long time. He said, "Histiaeus, I've heard that the deputy you appointed in Miletus has betrayed me. He brought men from the mainland, convinced some Ionians—who will pay for their actions—to join them, and took Sardis from me. Do you think this is right? How could this happen without your knowledge? Be careful not to blame yourself later." Histiaeus replied, "My lord, why would I plan something that could harm you in any way? I have everything I want, and I'm trusted with all your decisions. If my deputy did what you say, it must have been his own doing. I can't even believe the news that the Milesians and my deputy are causing you such trouble. However, if it's true and what you've heard is accurate, then it seems your decision to make me leave the coast was unwise. As soon as I was gone, the Ionians did what they had always wanted. If I had been in Ionia, no city would have dared to act. Now, please send me to Ionia immediately, so I can bring peace to the region and hand over the rebellious deputy of Miletus. Once I've done this, I swear by the gods of your royal house that I won't take off the tunic I'm wearing when I arrive in Ionia until I've made Sardo, the largest of the islands, a tributary to you." 
107. Histiaeus successfully tricked Darius with his words. Darius agreed to let him go, but instructed Histiaeus to return to Susa after he had accomplished what he had promised. 
108. While the news about Sardis was reaching the king, and Darius had done what I mentioned with his bow and allowed Histiaeus to go to the sea, the following events occurred. Onesilus of Salamis was besieging the people of Amathus when he heard that Artybius, a Persian, was expected to arrive in Cyprus with a large Persian army. Hearing this, Onesilus sent messengers throughout Ionia to gather support, and the Ionians quickly responded with a significant force. The Ionians arrived in Cyprus just as the Persians, coming from Cilicia, marched towards Salamis by land, while the Phoenicians sailed around the headland known as the keys of Cyprus. 
109. In response to the situation, the rulers of Cyprus gathered the Ionian generals and gave them a choice: either fight the Persians on land or the Phoenicians at sea. They said, "Ionians, if you want to face the Persians on land, then disembark and prepare for battle, and we will take your ships to fight the Phoenicians. If you prefer to fight the Phoenicians, do so, but make sure that both Ionia and Cyprus become free." The Ionians replied, "We were sent by the united voice of Ionia to protect the seas, not to hand over our ships to the Cypriots and fight the Persians on land. We will do our best in the task assigned to us. It's up to you to show your courage, remembering the suffering you endured under Median rule." 
110. The Ionians responded in this way, and later, when the Persian army arrived at the plain of Salamis, the Cypriot kings arranged their troops. They positioned the best Salaminian and Solian soldiers against the Persians, while the rest of the Cypriots faced the other parts of the enemy's army. Onesilus took his position directly opposite Artybius, the Persian general. 
111. Upon learning that Artybius' horse was trained to fight infantrymen by rearing up, Onesilus spoke to his brave Carian attendant, who was well-known for his skills in battle. He said, "I've heard that Artybius' horse rears up and attacks anyone it encounters. Considering this, decide and tell me who you'll focus on striking down: Artybius or his horse." His attendant replied, "My King, I'm ready to do either or both, as you wish. However, I'll tell you what I think is best for you. In my opinion, a king and general should face another king and general in battle. If you defeat a general, it's a great accomplishment. If he defeats you, which I hope won't happen, it's less of a tragedy to be killed by a noble enemy. As for us servants, it's appropriate that we fight against other servants and that horse. Don't worry about its tricks; I promise it will never fight anyone again." 
112. The attendant replied in this way, and soon after, battles erupted on both land and sea. The Ionians, showing exceptional skill that day, defeated the Phoenicians in their ships, with the Samnians being the bravest. On land, the armies clashed and fought. The two generals, Artybius and Onesilus, faced each other as agreed with his attendant. As Artybius charged towards him, Onesilus struck a blow. When the horse hit Onesilus' shield with its hooves, the Carian swiftly cut off the horse's legs with a swing of his curved sword. 
113. In this manner, Artybius, the Persian general, and his horse were defeated. While the battle continued, Stesenor, the ruler of Curium, believed to be an Argive settlement, betrayed his side with a large group of men under his command. The Salaminian war-chariots quickly followed suit, giving the Persians an advantage over the Cyprians. As a result, the Cyprian army was defeated, and many were killed, including Onesilus, son of Chersis, who had orchestrated the Cyprian rebellion, and Aristocyprus, the king of the Solians and son of Philocyprus. Philocyprus was the one whom Solon of Athens praised above all other rulers in a poem during his visit to Cyprus. 
114. When Onesilus was killed, the people of Amathus cut off his head and hung it above their city gates, as he had once laid siege to their city. Over time, the head became hollow and a swarm of bees filled it with honeycomb. The Amathusians, curious about this event, sought advice from an oracle. The oracle told them to remove the head, bury it, and offer an annual sacrifice to Onesilus as if he were a hero. By doing so, they were promised that their lives would improve. 
115. The Amathusians followed the oracle's advice and continued to do so ever since. Meanwhile, the Ionians who fought the sea battle near Cyprus found out that Onesilus' cause had failed and that all Cypriot cities, except for Salamis, which was returned to its former king Gorgus by the Salaminians, were under siege. So, they quickly sailed back to Ionia. Among the besieged cities, Soli held out the longest. The Persians finally captured it in the fifth month by digging a tunnel under its walls. 
116. The Cyprians, who had enjoyed freedom for a year, were once again enslaved. Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, all Persian generals and sons-in-law of Darius, chased the Ionians who had marched to Sardis and forced them to retreat to their ships. Following their victory, the Persian generals divided the conquered cities among themselves and plundered them. 
117. Daurises quickly captured the cities of the Hellespont, including Dardanus, Abydus, Percote, Lampsacus, and Paesus, each in just one day. While he was on his way from Paesus to attack Parius, he received news that the Carians had joined forces with the Ionians and rebelled against the Persians. As a result, he changed his course from the Hellespont and led his army towards Caria. 
118. News of Daurises' approach reached the Carians before his arrival. Upon hearing this, they gathered at a place called the White Pillars, near the Marsyas River, which flows from the Idria region and merges with the Maeander River. Many strategies were discussed, and the best one, in my opinion, came from Pixodarus of Cindya, the son of Mausolus and husband of the daughter of Syennesis, the king of Cilicia. He suggested that the Carians should cross the Maeander River and fight with the river behind them. This would force them to be braver, as they wouldn't be able to retreat. However, this idea was not accepted. Instead, they decided to position the Persians, not the Carians, with the Maeander River at their back. The intention was that if the Persians were defeated and forced to flee, they would not escape but be thrown into the river. 
119. Soon, the Persians arrived and crossed the Maeander River, engaging in battle with the Carians by the Marsyas River. The Carians fought fiercely and for a long time, but eventually, they were defeated due to the Persians' superior numbers. About two thousand Persians and ten thousand Carians were killed in the battle. The surviving Carians retreated to the sacred grove of Zeus of Armies at Labraunda, which was filled with large, holy plane trees. (The Carians are the only people known to worship Zeus under this name.) Once there, they discussed their options for survival, debating whether to surrender to the Persians or leave Asia altogether. 
120. As the Carians were discussing their options, help arrived in the form of the Milesians and their allies. With this support, the Carians abandoned their previous plans and decided to continue fighting. However, when they faced the Persians again, they suffered an even greater defeat than before. Many soldiers from both sides were killed, but the Milesians were hit the hardest. 
121. Despite their losses, the Carians didn't give up and prepared to fight again. They learned that the Persians were planning to march towards their cities, so they set up an ambush at Pedasus. The Persians unknowingly walked into this trap at night and were defeated, along with their generals Daurises, Amorges, and Sisimaces. Myrsus, the son of Gyges, also perished in the battle. The mastermind behind this ambush was Heraclides of Mylasas, the son of Ibanollis. 
122. This is how those Persians met their end. Hymaees, who had been chasing the Ionians that attacked Sardis, turned his attention towards the Propontis and captured Cius in Mysia. Upon hearing that Daurises had left the Hellespont and was heading towards Caria, Hymaees left the Propontis and led his army to the Hellespont. He conquered all the Aeolians living in the Ilium region and the Gergithae, who were descendants of the ancient Trojans. However, while he was in the process of conquering these lands, Hymaees fell ill and died in the Troad. 
123. This is how he died. After his death, Artaphrenes, the governor of Sardis, and Otanes, the third general, were chosen to lead the army against Ionia and the neighboring Aeolian region. They successfully captured Clazomenae in Ionia and Cyme in Aeolia. 
124. Aristagoras of Miletus, as it became evident, was not a very brave man. After causing chaos in Ionia, he realized the consequences of his actions and started thinking about escaping. He also believed that it was impossible to defeat Darius. As cities were being captured, he gathered his fellow rebels to discuss their options. He suggested that they should have a backup plan in case they were forced out of Miletus. He asked them whether they should move to a settlement in Sardo or Myrcinus in Edonia, which Histiaeus had received as a gift from Darius and had fortified. 
125. The historian Hecataeus, son of Hegesander, disagreed with both options. He suggested that instead of going to either of those places, Aristagoras should build a stronghold on the island of Leros and live there if he was forced out of Miletus. Later, he could use Leros as a base to return to Miletus. 
126. Hecataeus gave his advice, but Aristagoras decided it was better to go to Myrcinus. He left Miletus in the hands of Pythagoras, a respected citizen, and set sail to Thrace with anyone who wanted to join him. Once there, he took control of the place. However, he and his army were killed by the Thracians while attacking a town, even though the Thracians were willing to leave it under a treaty.
