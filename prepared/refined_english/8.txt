1. The Greeks assigned to the naval fleet were as follows: Athens provided 127 ships, with Plataeans helping to crew them, not because they knew about sailing, but because they were brave and enthusiastic. Corinth contributed 40 ships, Megara 20, Chalcis 20 (with Athens supplying the ships), Aegina 18, Sicyon 12, Lacedaemon 10, Epidaurus 8, Eretria 7, Troezen 5, Styra 2, and Ceos 2, along with two 50-oared boats. The Opuntian Locrians also supported them with seven 50-oared boats. 
2. The forces that gathered at Artemisium for battle included a total of 271 ships, not counting the 50-oared boats. Each group contributed a specific number of ships, as previously mentioned. The Spartans, led by Admiral Eurybiades, son of Euryclides, were in overall command. The allies insisted on having a Spartan leader, stating that they would rather disband the fleet than be led by the Athenians. 
3. In the beginning, before seeking an alliance with Sicily, there was a discussion about giving the Athenians control of the naval command. However, when the allies objected, the Athenians decided not to insist on their claim. They believed that the safety of Greece was more important and understood that if they fought over leadership, Greece would be destroyed. They knew that internal conflict was worse than a united war, which in turn was worse than peace. So, they stepped back from their claim, but only as long as they needed the support of the others. This became evident when, after pushing back the Persians and no longer fighting for their own land, they used Pausanias' arrogance as an excuse to take command away from the Spartans. But all of this happened later. 
4. When the Greeks finally arrived at Artemisium, they saw a large number of ships and troops at Aphetae, and the enemy appeared much stronger than they had expected. As a result, they lost confidence and started discussing the possibility of retreating back to Greece. The people of Euboea, noticing these plans, asked Eurybiades to wait a while so they could evacuate their families. When they couldn't convince him, they tried another approach and offered Themistocles, the Athenian admiral, a bribe of thirty talents to keep the Greek fleet there and fight to defend Euboea when the battle took place. 
5. Themistocles managed to keep the Greeks at Artemisium by giving Eurybiades five talents of the bribe money, making it seem like a personal gift. Once Eurybiades was convinced, most of the others agreed to stay, except for Adimantus, the Corinthian admiral, who insisted on leaving. Themistocles then swore to give Adimantus a greater gift than what the Persian king would offer for betraying the allies. He sent three talents of silver to Adimantus' ship, which persuaded him to stay. In the end, the Euboeans got their wish, and Themistocles secretly kept the remaining money. No one knew about this, and those who received a share believed it was sent by the Athenians for that purpose. 
6. The Greeks stayed in Euboea and fought there, and here's how it happened. The enemy arrived at Aphetae in the early afternoon and saw the small number of Greek ships near Artemisium, which they had heard about earlier. They were eager to attack and capture these ships. However, they didn't want to launch a direct attack, as they worried the Greeks would see them coming and escape under the cover of night. They believed the Greeks would try to flee, and they didn't want even the smallest ship to be saved. 
7. Considering these factors, they came up with a plan. They separated 200 ships from the main fleet and sent them on a secret route around Sciathus, Euboea, and Caphereus, towards Geraestus and Euripus. This way, they could trap the Greeks between the two groups, with one blocking their escape route and the main fleet attacking from the front. They decided not to attack the Greeks until they saw a signal from the ships that had sailed around. With this plan in place, they sent the 200 ships on their mission and began counting the remaining ships at Aphetae. 
8. During the counting of the ships, there was a man named Scyllias from Scione in the Persian fleet. He was the best diver of his time and had saved many valuable items for the Persians during a shipwreck at Pelion, also gaining some for himself. Scyllias had been planning to join the Greeks, but he hadn't found the right opportunity until now. It's unclear exactly how he made his way to the Greeks. One incredible story claims that he dove into the sea at Aphetae and swam underwater for about eighty furlongs, only resurfacing at Artemisium. There are many stories about Scyllias, some believable and some not, but in this case, it's more likely that he reached Artemisium in a boat. Once there, he immediately informed the Greek admirals about the shipwreck and the ships sent around Euboea. 
9. Upon hearing this news, the Greeks discussed their options. There were many ideas, but they ultimately decided to stay where they were for the day. After midnight, they planned to set sail and confront the ships that were sailing around. However, since they didn't face any resistance, they changed their minds and decided to move their ships towards the enemy in the late afternoon. They wanted to test the enemy's fighting style and their ability to break through the line. 
10. When Xerxes' soldiers and generals saw the Greeks approaching with only a few ships, they believed the Greeks had gone mad. They set sail, expecting an easy victory, which seemed reasonable since their fleet was much larger and their ships were more seaworthy. Confidently, they surrounded the Greeks. The Ionians who were friendly to the Greeks reluctantly joined the battle and were worried when they saw the Greeks trapped. They thought none of the Greeks would make it back home, as they appeared to be at a significant disadvantage. However, those who were happy about the situation competed with each other to be the first to capture an Athenian ship and receive rewards from the king, as the Athenians were the most talked-about in the fleet. 
11. When the signal was given, the Greeks first pulled the sterns of their ships together, facing the enemy with their prows. At the second signal, they began to fight, even though they were trapped in a tight space and had to battle face-to-face. They managed to capture thirty enemy ships, including one carrying Philaon, the brother of Gorgus, the king of Salamis. Philaon was an important figure in the fleet. An Athenian named Lycomedes, son of Aeschraeus, was the first Greek to capture an enemy ship, and he received a prize for his bravery. The battle was evenly matched, and when night fell, both sides retreated â€“ the Greeks to Artemisium and the Persians to Aphetae. The Persians had not achieved the victory they had hoped for. During the battle, Antidorus of Lemnos, the only Greek fighting with the Persians, switched sides and joined the Greeks. In gratitude, the Athenians gave him land in Salamis. 
12. As night fell during midsummer, heavy rain and loud thunderstorms from Pelion filled the sky. The dead bodies and wreckage from the battle were pushed towards Aphetae, where they became entangled with the ships' prows and tangled the oars. The crews on the ships were frightened by the noise and, given their current situation, feared total destruction. They had already experienced a shipwreck and storm off Pelion, followed by a tough sea battle. Now, they had to endure pouring rain, strong torrents flowing towards the sea, and intense thunderstorms. 
13. That night was difficult for them. However, it was even more challenging for those who were assigned to sail around Euboea, as they were caught in the open sea. They faced a terrible fate when the storm and rain hit them near the Hollows of Euboea. The wind blew them off course and forced them onto the rocks. This was all done by the gods to ensure that the Persian and Greek forces were more evenly matched, preventing the Persians from having a significant advantage. 
14. The men near the Hollows of Euboea perished. Meanwhile, the Persians at Aphetae were relieved when daylight arrived. Given their difficult situation, they decided not to move their ships for the time being. Soon, fifty-three Athenian ships arrived to help the Greeks, boosting their morale. They were also encouraged by the news that the Persians sailing around Euboea had been wiped out by the recent storm. The Greeks waited for the same hour as before and attacked some Cilician ships when they set sail. After destroying these ships, they returned to Artemisium as night fell. 
15. On the third day, the Persian admirals couldn't stand the damage caused by the few Greek ships and feared Xerxes' anger. They didn't wait for the Greeks to start the fight and set sail around noon. As a result, these sea battles took place on the same days as the land battles at Thermopylae. The sailors tried to control the Euripus while Leonidas' men defended the passage. The Greeks were instructed to prevent the Persians from entering Greece, while the Persians aimed to defeat the Greek forces and conquer the strait. 
16. When Xerxes' forces prepared for battle and advanced, the Greeks stayed near Artemisium. The Persians tried to form a half-circle with their ships to surround and trap the Greeks. In response, the Greeks charged and engaged in battle. Both sides experienced equal success during the fight. The large number and size of Xerxes' ships caused problems, as they became disorganized and collided with each other. However, they refused to retreat, not wanting to be defeated by a smaller fleet. Many Greek and Persian ships and men were lost in the battle, with the Persians suffering even greater losses. Eventually, both sides withdrew and separated from each other. 
17. During that sea battle, the Egyptians in Xerxes' forces displayed the greatest courage. Among their many accomplishments, they captured five Greek ships along with their crews. As for the Greeks, the Athenians were the most outstanding, and among them, Clinias, son of Alcibiades, stood out. He contributed a ship and two hundred men to the war, all funded by himself. 
18. After the battle, both sides quickly returned to their own bases. The Greeks, who gained control of the area where the dead and wreckage were, had also faced difficulties, especially the Athenians, as half of their ships were damaged. They then decided to retreat to the safer waters within Greece. 
19. Themistocles believed that if the Ionian and Carian forces were removed from the enemy's side, the Greeks might have a better chance of winning. The people of Euboea usually brought their livestock to the sea. Themistocles gathered the admirals and shared his plan to lure away the king's strongest allies, without revealing all the details. He suggested that they should take as many animals from the Euboean herds as they wanted, so their fleet could benefit rather than the enemy. He also advised them to light fires and promised to ensure their safe return to Greece. The admirals agreed and followed his instructions, lighting fires and taking the livestock. 
20. The people of Euboea had ignored Bacis' oracle, thinking it had no meaning, and they didn't take any precautions against the arrival of an enemy. This led to their own downfall, as the oracle's prophecy about this situation went like this: "When a foreign-speaking man throws a papyrus yoke on the waves, be sure to keep the bleating goats away from Euboea's shores." The Euboeans didn't pay attention to these words, and as a result, they faced great misfortune during the current and upcoming troubles. 
21. While the Greeks were busy with their tasks, a lookout from Trachis arrived. At Artemisium, a scout named Polyas from Anticyra was responsible for informing the men at Thermopylae if the fleet faced any defeat, and he had a rowing boat ready for this purpose. Similarly, if the land army faced any trouble, an Athenian named Abronichus, son of Lysicles, was with Leonidas to bring the news to the Greeks at Artemisium using a thirty-oared boat. So, Abronichus arrived and told them about the fate of Leonidas and his army. Upon hearing this, the Greeks didn't waste any more time and began to leave in their assigned order, with the Corinthians going first and the Athenians leaving last. 
22. Themistocles selected the best Athenian ships and went to places where they could find drinking water. He wrote a message on the rocks, which the Ionians read the next day when they arrived at Artemisium. The message said: "Ionians, it's wrong to fight against your homeland and bring slavery to Greece. It's better to join us, or if that's not possible, withdraw from the war and ask the Carians to do the same. If you can't do either, don't use your full strength in battle. Remember, you are our descendants, and this conflict with the barbarians started because of you." Themistocles likely had two reasons for writing this message. If King Xerxes didn't know about it, the Ionians might switch sides and join the Greeks. But if someone reported the message to Xerxes, he might become suspicious of the Ionians and not let them participate in sea battles. 
23. Themistocles had written this message. Soon after, a man from Histiaea arrived in a boat, telling the barbarians that the Greeks had fled from Artemisium. Not believing him, they held him captive and sent fast ships to verify the information. When the crews confirmed the truth, the entire fleet sailed to Artemisium at dawn. They waited there until noon and then sailed to Histiaea. Upon arriving, they took control of the city of Histiaea and occupied all the villages along the coast of the Ellopian region, which was part of Histiaea. 
24. While they were there, Xerxes sent a messenger to the fleet. Before doing so, he prepared the following: he left about a thousand of his own soldiers who had died at Thermopylae (out of around twenty thousand) and buried the rest in trenches, covering them with leaves and dirt so that the fleet members wouldn't see them. When the messenger arrived at Histiaea, he gathered all the men of the fleet and said: "Allies, King Xerxes allows anyone who wishes to leave their position and come to see how he fights against those foolish men who thought they could defeat the king's power." 
25. After the announcement, boats were in high demand as many people wanted to see the dead. They crossed over and looked at the fallen Greeks, thinking they were all Lacedaemonians and Thespians, although there were also helots among them. However, those who crossed over weren't fooled by Xerxes' attempt to hide his own dead, as it seemed ridiculous. They could see a thousand Persians dead, while the Greeks were all gathered in one place, numbering four thousand. They spent the entire day observing, and the next day, the sailors returned to their fleet at Histiaea, while Xerxes' army continued its march. 
26. A few deserters from Arcadia, who were looking for work, had joined the Persians. They were brought before the king, and the Persians asked them what the Greeks were doing. One of them spoke on behalf of the group. The Arcadians said that the Greeks were celebrating the Olympic festival and watching sports and horse races. The Persian asked what prize the Greeks were competing for. They told him about the olive wreath given to the winner. Hearing this, Tigranes, the son of Artabanus, made a remarkable statement (although the king thought he was a coward for saying it). He couldn't stay silent and exclaimed, "Wow, Mardonius, what kind of people have you put us up against? They're not fighting for money, but for the glory of achievement!" That was what Tigranes said. 
27. Soon after the unfortunate event at Thermopylae, the Thessalians sent a messenger to the Phocians, as they had an old grudge against them, which had grown stronger due to their recent defeat. A few years before the king's invasion, the Thessalians and their allies had attacked Phocis with their entire army but were defeated and badly treated by the Phocians.  During the siege on Parnassus, the Phocians had a diviner named Tellias from Elis with them. Tellias came up with a plan: he covered six hundred of the bravest Phocians and their armor with gypsum and led them to attack the Thessalians at night, instructing them to kill anyone they saw who wasn't covered in white. The Thessalian guards were the first to see these men and ran away in fear, mistakenly thinking it was something supernatural. After the guards, the entire Thessalian army fled as well. The Phocians took control of four thousand dead bodies and their shields, dedicating half of them at Abae and the rest at Delphi. A tenth of their winnings from that battle was used to create the large statues surrounding the tripod in front of the shrine at Delphi, and there are similar statues dedicated at Abae. 
28. The Phocians had previously dealt with the Thessalian foot soldiers during the siege. When the Thessalian horsemen entered their territory, the Phocians came up with a plan to cause them serious damage. They dug a large pit near the pass close to Hyampolis and placed empty jars inside it. Then, they covered the pit with soil, making it look like the rest of the ground, and waited for the Thessalians to arrive. The Thessalian horsemen charged forward, intending to drive the Phocians away, but instead, they fell into the pit filled with jars. As a result, their horses' legs were broken. 
29. The Thessalians had never forgiven the Phocians for these two incidents, and now they sent a messenger with the following message: "People of Phocis, it's time to admit that you're no match for us. The Greeks have always favored us over you, even when we were on their side. Now, we have such influence with the foreigners that we can take away your lands and enslave you. However, even though we could easily do this, we don't hold any grudges for the past. Just pay us fifty talents of silver for what you did, and we promise to protect your land from any threats." 
30. The Thessalians made an offer to the Phocians. The Phocians were the only ones in the region who refused to join the Persians, and this was mainly due to their hatred for the Thessalians. If the Thessalians had supported the Greeks, the Phocians would have most likely sided with the Persians. In response to the Thessalians' offer, the Phocians said they wouldn't give any money. They told the Thessalians that they could join the Persians if they wanted to, but they wouldn't willingly betray the Greek cause. 
31. When the Thessalians received this response, they became angry with the Phocians and decided to guide the foreign invaders through the land. They led the invaders from the Trachis region into Doris, a narrow strip of Dorian land about thirty furlongs wide, located between the Malian and Phocian territories. This area, once known as Dryopian, was the homeland of the Dorians in the Peloponnese. The foreign invaders did not harm the Dorian territory during their invasion, as the people there had sided with the Persians. The Thessalians also wanted to ensure that the Dorians were not harmed. 
32. When the invaders moved from Doris into Phocis, they couldn't capture the Phocians, as many of them had fled to the heights of Mount Parnassus. The peak of Parnassus, called Tithorea, which stands alone near the town of Neon, had enough space for a large number of people. The Phocians took their belongings there, while others left the country and went to the Ozolian Locrians, where the town of Amphissa is located above the Crisaean plain. As the Thessalians guided the foreign army, the invaders swept through the entire region of Phocis. They destroyed and burned everything they came across, including towns and temples. 
33. As they marched along the Cephisus River, the invaders destroyed everything in their path, burning the towns of Drymus, Charadra, Erochus, Tethronium, Amphicaea, Neon, Pediea, Tritea, Elatea, Hyampolis, Parapotamii, and Abae. In Abae, there was a richly endowed temple dedicated to Apollo, filled with treasures and offerings. A place for divination also existed there. The invaders plundered and burned this temple as well, and they chased and captured some of the Phocians near the mountains. Some women also lost their lives due to the excessive violence they faced. 
34. After passing Parapotamii, the invaders arrived at Panopea. At this point, their army split into two groups. The larger and stronger part of the army, led by Xerxes, headed towards Athens and entered the region of Orchomenus in Boeotia. The entire population of Boeotia sided with the Persians, and men from Macedonia, sent by Alexander, protected their towns, each in their assigned locations. The purpose of this protection was to show Xerxes that the Boeotians supported the Persian cause. 
35. The other part of the invading army, guided by locals, headed towards the temple at Delphi, with Mount Parnassus on their right. They too destroyed every part of Phocis they occupied, burning the towns of the Panopeans, Daulii, and Aeolidae. Their reason for separating from the main army and taking this route was to plunder the temple at Delphi and present its wealth to Xerxes. It is said that Xerxes had a better understanding of the most valuable items in the temple than of those in his own palace, particularly the offerings made by Croesus, son of Alyattes, as these were often talked about. 
36. When the people of Delphi heard about the invaders, they became very scared. Unsure of what to do, they asked the oracle if they should hide the sacred treasure or move it to another country. The god replied that they shouldn't move anything, as he could protect his own belongings. After hearing this, the Delphians focused on their own safety. They sent their children and women to Achaia, across the sea. Most of the men went up to the peaks of Mount Parnassus and hid their belongings in the Corycian cave, while some fled to Amphissa in Locris. In the end, all the Delphians left the town except for sixty men and the prophet. 
37. As the invaders approached and could see the temple, the prophet named Aceratus noticed sacred weapons, which were not to be touched, had been moved from the inner chamber and placed in front of the shrine. He went to inform the Delphians about this miraculous event. However, when the invaders quickly reached the temple of Athena Pronaea, they experienced even greater miracles. While it was amazing that the weapons had moved on their own, what happened next was even more astonishing. As the invaders neared the temple of Athena Pronaea, they were struck by lightning from the sky, and two large pieces of Mount Parnassus broke off and crashed among them, causing a loud noise and killing many. Additionally, a shout and a cry of victory were heard coming from the temple of Athena. 
38. All these events caused the invaders to panic, and the Delphians, noticing their fear, attacked them and killed many. The remaining invaders fled back to Boeotia. Those who returned reportedly saw other supernatural signs in addition to the ones mentioned earlier: they claimed that two giant warriors had chased and killed them, with a size beyond that of normal humans. 
39. The Delphians believe that these two giant warriors were their local heroes, Phylacus and Autonous. Phylacus' shrine is located near the temple, above the shrine of Athena Pronaea, and Autonous' shrine is close to the Castalian spring, beneath the Hyarapean Peak. In my time, the rocks that fell from Mount Parnassus could still be seen, lying in the area of Athena Pronaea, where they had crashed through the invaders' ranks. This is how the invaders were driven away from the temple. 
40. At the request of the Athenians, the Greek fleet moved from Artemisium and arrived at Salamis. The Athenians wanted them to come to Salamis so they could safely move their children and women out of Attica and discuss their next steps. Their previous plans had failed, so they needed to discuss the current situation. They had hoped to find the entire population of the Peloponnese in Boeotia, ready to face the invaders, but that wasn't the case. Instead, they discovered that the people were fortifying the Isthmus, focusing on protecting the Peloponnese and ignoring everything else. Upon learning this, the Athenians asked the fleet to come to Salamis. 
41. As the others arrived at Salamis, the Athenians went back to their own land. Once there, they announced that every Athenian should save their children and servants in the best way possible. As a result, most of them sent their families to Troezen, while some went to Aegina and Salamis. They were eager to ensure everyone's safety, not only because of the oracle's advice but also due to a local belief: the Athenians believed that a large snake lived in the sacred area, guarding the acropolis. They even left monthly offerings of honey-cakes for the snake as if it truly existed. Until that time, the honey-cakes had always been eaten, but this time they remained untouched. The priestess interpreted this as a sign that the goddess had abandoned the acropolis, which made the Athenians even more determined to leave the city. Once they had moved everyone to safety, they returned to their camp. 
42. When the ships from Artemisium arrived at Salamis, the rest of the Greek fleet, which had gathered at Troezen, learned about it and joined them. They had been ordered to meet at Pogon, Troezen's harbor. Now, even more ships and cities were involved than those that had fought at Artemisium. The fleet was still led by Eurybiades, son of Euryclides, a Spartan but not of royal blood. Among all the ships, the Athenians provided the largest number and the most reliable vessels. 
43. The following groups participated in the war: from the Peloponnese, the Lacedaemonians provided sixteen ships; the Corinthians contributed the same number as at Artemisium; the Sicyonians supplied fifteen ships, the Epidaurians ten, the Troezenians five, and the Hermioneans three. All of these groups, except for the Hermioneans, were Dorian and Macedonian, originally coming from Erineus, Pindus, and the Dryopian region. The Hermioneans were Dryopians, who had been driven out of the area now known as Doris by Herakles and the Malians. 
44. The following groups from the mainland outside the Peloponnese participated in the war: the Athenians provided the largest contribution with 180 ships. They did this alone, as the Plataeans did not fight alongside the Athenians at Salamis for a specific reason: when the Greeks left Artemisium and were near Chalcis, the Plataeans went to the opposite shore of Boeotia to move their families to safety. In doing so, they were left behind. In the past, when the Pelasgians ruled the region now known as Hellas, the Athenians were Pelasgians and were called Cranai. When Cecrops became their king, they were named Cecropidae, and when Erechtheus took over, they changed their name to Athenians. However, when Ion, son of Xuthus, became the commander of the Athenian army, they were named Ionians after him. 
45. The Megarians contributed the same number of ships as they did at Artemisium. The Ampraciots joined the effort with seven ships, and the Leucadians, who are Dorians from Corinth, supported with three ships. 
46. The islanders contributed to the war effort as follows: the Aeginetans provided thirty ships, keeping their other manned ships to guard their own land, and fought at Salamis with their thirty most seaworthy vessels. The Aeginetans are Dorians from Epidaurus, and their island was once called Oenone. The Chalcidians joined with the same twenty ships they had at Artemisium, as did the Eretrians with their seven ships; both groups are Ionians. The Ceans, also Ionians from Athens, participated with the same ships as before. The Naxians contributed four ships, even though they were initially sent by their fellow citizens to join the Persians like the rest of the islanders. However, they decided to support the Greeks instead, encouraged by Democritus, a respected town leader and captain of a trireme at the time. The Naxians are Ionians descended from Athens. The Styrians provided the same number of ships as at Artemisium, while the Cythnians contributed one trireme and a fifty-oared boat; both groups are Dryopians. The Seriphians, Siphnians, and Melians also participated in the war, as they were the only islanders who had not submitted to the Persians by offering earth and water. 
47. All the people living on this side of Thesprotia and the Acheron river participated in the war. The Thesprotians were neighbors to the Ampraciots and Leucadians, who came from the farthest lands to join the war effort. The only ones living beyond these areas who helped Greece in its time of need were the Crotonians, who contributed one ship. Its captain was Phayllus, a three-time winner of the Pythian games. The Crotonians are of Achaean origin. 
48. All of these groups joined the war with triremes, except for the Melians, Siphnians, and Seriphians, who brought fifty-oared boats. The Melians, who are of Lacedaemonian origin, provided two boats; the Siphnians and Seriphians, who are Ionians from Athens, contributed one boat each. In total, there were three hundred and seventy-eight ships, not including the fifty-oared boats. 
49. When the generals from the mentioned cities gathered at Salamis, they held a meeting where Eurybiades suggested that everyone should share their thoughts on the most suitable location for a sea battle, considering that Attica was already lost. They needed to focus on the remaining places. Most of the speakers agreed that they should sail to the Isthmus and fight at sea for the Peloponnese. They reasoned that if they were defeated in the battle at Salamis, they would be trapped on an island with no help available. However, if they were at the Isthmus, they could retreat to their own lands if needed. 
50. As the generals from the Peloponnese were discussing this plan, an Athenian messenger arrived with news that the barbarians had invaded Attica and were burning everything in their path. Xerxes' army had marched through Boeotia, setting fire to the cities of Thespians and Plataea, whose citizens had abandoned their homes and fled to the Peloponnese. Now, the army had reached Athens and was causing widespread destruction. The Thebans informed the invaders that Thespia and Plataea had not sided with the Persians, which led to their burning. 
51. The barbarians had started their journey by crossing the Hellespont into Europe, spending one month there. In three more months, they arrived in Attica when Calliades was the leader of Athens. When they captured the city, it was mostly empty. However, they found a few Athenians in the sacred area, including caretakers and poor people, who defended themselves by barricading the acropolis with doors and logs. They hadn't left for Salamis not only because they were poor, but also because they believed they had understood the oracle's prophecy given by the Pythia. The prophecy stated that the wooden wall would be indestructible, and they thought this referred to their barricade, not the ships, as their safe haven. 
52. The Persians positioned themselves on a hill across from the acropolis, which the Athenians called the Areopagus, and began their siege. They set fire to arrows wrapped in tar and shot them at the barricade. Despite being in great danger and their barricade failing, the besieged Athenians continued to defend themselves. They refused to surrender when the Pisistratids offered terms and instead devised defenses like rolling large rocks onto the barbarians when they approached the gates. Xerxes was puzzled for a long time, unable to capture the determined Athenians. 
53. Eventually, the barbarians found a solution to their problem, as the oracle had predicted that all of mainland Attica would fall under Persian control. In front of the acropolis, behind the gates and the steep path, there was an unguarded area that no one believed could be climbed. However, some men managed to climb up this sheer cliff near the sacred area dedicated to Cecrops' daughter, Aglaurus. When the Athenians saw the invaders had reached the acropolis, some jumped off the wall to their deaths, while others fled into the inner chamber. The first Persians to reach the top went to the gates, opened them, and killed those seeking refuge. After destroying everything, they looted the sacred area and set fire to the entire acropolis. 
54. Xerxes successfully captured Athens and sent a rider to Susa to inform Artabanus of his victory. The day after sending the message, he gathered the Athenian exiles with him and asked them to go to the acropolis and perform their traditional sacrifices. This request might have been due to a dream he had or because he felt guilty for burning the sacred area. The Athenian exiles followed his orders and carried out the sacrifices. 
55. I mention this for a specific reason. Inside the acropolis, there is a shrine dedicated to Erechtheus, known as the "Earthborn." Within the shrine, there is an olive tree and a saltwater pool. According to Athenian legend, these were placed there by Poseidon and Athena as symbols during their competition for the land. The olive tree was burned by the barbarians along with the rest of the sacred area. However, the day after the burning, when the Athenians were ordered by the king to perform sacrifices, they went to the sacred area and saw a new shoot, about a cubit long, growing from the tree stump. They shared this news with others. 
56. When news about the situation at the Athenian acropolis reached the Greeks at Salamis, some of the Peloponnesian generals were so frightened that they didn't wait for a decision on the proposed plan. Instead, they quickly got into their ships and prepared to flee. The remaining generals decided that the fleet should fight for the Isthmus. As night fell, they ended their meeting and returned to their ships. 
57. When Themistocles returned to his ship, an Athenian named Mnesiphilus asked him about the decision that had been made. Upon learning that they planned to sail to the Isthmus and fight for the Peloponnese, Mnesiphilus said, "If they leave Salamis, you won't be fighting for just one country anymore. Everyone will go back to their own city, and neither Eurybiades nor anyone else will be able to stop them from breaking up the army. Greece will be destroyed because of poor planning. If there's any way you can convince Eurybiades to change his mind and stay here, go and try to reverse this decision." 
58. Themistocles was very pleased with this advice. He didn't respond but instead went to Eurybiades' ship. When he got there, he said he wanted to discuss an important matter, so Eurybiades invited him aboard to share his thoughts. Themistocles sat next to him and shared everything he had heard from Mnesiphilus, pretending it was his own idea and adding more details. In the end, he successfully convinced Eurybiades to leave the ship and gather the generals for a war council. 
59. When the generals gathered and before Eurybiades could explain why he had called the meeting, Themistocles began to speak passionately about the importance of his request. While he was talking, the Corinthian general Adeimantus, son of Ocytus, interrupted, saying, "Themistocles, in games, those who start before the signal are punished with sticks." Themistocles replied, "But those who are left behind don't win any prizes." 
60. Themistocles responded calmly to the Corinthian and didn't repeat his earlier argument to Eurybiades about the allies scattering if they left Salamis. Instead, he presented a different point of view, saying, "You have the power to save Greece if you listen to me and stay here to fight, rather than following others' advice and moving your ships to the Isthmus. Let me explain the benefits of each plan. If you fight at the Isthmus, you'll be in the open sea, which is not in our favor since our ships are heavier and fewer. You'll also lose Salamis, Megara, and Aegina, even if we succeed in everything else. Their land army will follow their fleet, and you'll lead them to the Peloponnese, putting all of Greece at risk. However, if you follow my advice, you'll see the benefits: first, by fighting with our few ships against their many in the narrow strait, we have a better chance of winning, as it's to our advantage to fight in a confined space and theirs to fight in a wide area. Second, Salamis will be safe, where we've taken our children and women for protection. By staying here, you'll still be defending the Peloponnese just as much as at the Isthmus, and you won't lead the enemy there if you make the right decision. If things go as I expect and we win the naval battle, the enemy won't reach the Isthmus. They'll go no further than Attica and leave in disarray. We'll gain an advantage by keeping Megara, Aegina, and Salamis safe, where it's prophesied that we'll defeat our enemies. People usually succeed when they have well-thought-out plans. If their plans are unreasonable, the gods don't support their intentions." 
61. As Themistocles spoke, Adeimantus the Corinthian criticized him again, suggesting that a man without a city should stay quiet and that Eurybiades shouldn't listen to someone without a city. He said this because Athens had been captured and occupied. This time, Themistocles strongly defended himself and the Athenians, arguing that as long as they had two hundred fully-crewed ships, the Athenians still had a city and land greater than the Corinthians. He added that no other Greeks could stop them if they decided to attack. 
62. Then, Themistocles focused on Eurybiades, speaking more passionately than before, "If you stay here, you'll be a great leader. If not, you'll bring disaster to Greece. Our power lies in our ships, so please listen to me. If you don't, we'll immediately gather our families and move to Siris in Italy, a place that has been ours since ancient times and where prophecies say we must establish a colony. You'll remember my words when you no longer have allies like us." 
63. After hearing Themistocles' words, Eurybiades changed his decision. I believe his main concern was that the Athenians might abandon them if they sailed to the Isthmus. Without the Athenians, the remaining forces wouldn't stand a chance against the enemy. So, Eurybiades chose to stay and fight. 
64. Following this heated debate, Eurybiades made up his mind, and the men at Salamis got ready to fight right where they were. The next day, at sunrise, there was an earthquake on both land and sea. They decided to pray to the gods and ask for the help of Aeacus' sons. After making this decision, they prayed to all the gods, invited Ajax and Telamon to join them from Salamis, and sent a ship to Aegina to bring Aeacus and his sons. 
65. Dicaeus, the son of Theocydes, was an Athenian exile who had gained importance among the Medes. He said that when Xerxes' army was destroying Attica and no Athenians were around, he and Demaratus, a Lacedaemonian, were on the Thriasian plain. They saw a cloud of dust approaching from Eleusis, as if created by around thirty thousand people. They wondered who could be causing such a dust cloud and then heard a cry. The cry sounded like the "Iacchus" from the Eleusinian mysteries. Demaratus, unfamiliar with the Eleusinian rites, asked Dicaeus about the sound. Dicaeus replied, "Demaratus, this sound means a great disaster will surely happen to the king's army. Since Attica is empty, this divine voice must be coming from Eleusis to help the Athenians and their allies. If it goes to the Peloponnese, the king and his mainland army will be in danger. But if it heads towards the ships at Salamis, the king's fleet will be at risk. Every year, the Athenians celebrate this festival for the Mother and the Maiden, and any Athenian or other Greek can participate. The 'Iacchus' cry you hear is from this festival." Demaratus advised Dicaeus to stay quiet and not share this with anyone else. If the king heard about it, Dicaeus could lose his life, and no one, not even Demaratus, could save him. Demaratus told him to be silent and let the gods handle the army. After the dust and cry, a cloud rose and floated towards Salamis, where the Greek camp was. This made them realize that Xerxes' fleet would be destroyed. Dicaeus, the son of Theocydes, used to tell this story, calling on Demaratus and others as witnesses. 
66. When the people with Xerxes' fleet saw the disaster in Laconia at Thermopylae, they moved from Trachis to Histiaea. After waiting for three days, they sailed through the Euripus channel, and in three more days, they arrived at Phalerum, the port of Athens. I believe the number of invaders who attacked Athens by land and sea was no less than those who came to Sepias and Thermopylae. The losses from the storm, at Thermopylae, and in the naval battles at Artemisium were balanced by those who hadn't yet joined the king: the Melians, Dorians, Locrians, and all the Boeotian forces except the Thespians and Plataeans; as well as the Carystians, Andrians, Teneans, and all the other islanders, except the five cities I mentioned earlier. The deeper the Persians went into Greece, the more nations followed them. 
67. All of them went to Athens, except for the Parians. The Parians stayed behind in Cythnus, waiting to see the outcome of the war. When the rest arrived at Phalerum, Xerxes went to the ships, wanting to talk with the sailors and hear their opinions. He sat on his throne, and the rulers of all the nations and the fleet's leaders were summoned. They sat according to the honor the king had given them, with the king of Sidon first, followed by the king of Tyre, and then the others. Once they were seated, Xerxes sent Mardonius to ask each of them if they should engage in a sea battle. 
68. Mardonius began questioning them, starting with the Sidonian. All of them agreed that they should fight at sea, but Artemisia had a different opinion. She said, "Tell the king, Mardonius, that I, who was neither the most cowardly in the sea battles off Euboea nor performed the least feats of arms, have this to say: 'Master, I will share my honest opinion, which I believe is best for your cause. I advise you not to use your ships and avoid fighting at sea. Our enemies are much stronger at sea than we are, just as men are stronger than women. Why risk everything in a sea battle? You have already captured Athens, which was your goal, and you control the rest of Greece. No one is stopping you. Those who opposed you have been punished. I will tell you how I think things will turn out for your enemies: If you don't rush into a sea battle and keep your ships here, staying close to land or even advancing into the Peloponnese, you will easily achieve your goals. The Greeks won't be able to resist you for long, and they will eventually scatter and flee to their own cities. I've learned that they don't have enough food on this island, and if you lead your army against the Peloponnese, those who came from there won't stay idle, nor will they want to fight at sea for Athens. However, if you rush into a sea battle right away, I'm afraid that if your fleet is defeated, it may also harm your land army. Also, my King, remember this: Good people often have bad slaves, and bad people often have good slaves. You, being the best among men, have bad slaves who are considered your allies - the Egyptians, Cyprians, Cilicians, and Pamphylians, who are of no use at all.'" 
69. When Artemisia shared her opinion with Mardonius, those who liked her were worried, thinking she would face trouble from the king for advising against a sea battle. However, those who were jealous of her, because she was highly respected among the allies, were happy with her answer, thinking she would be killed. But when Xerxes heard about the advice, he was very pleased with Artemisia's opinion. He had already thought highly of her, and now he praised her even more. Nevertheless, he decided to follow the majority's advice, as he believed that his forces had fought poorly at Euboea on purpose because he wasn't there. This time, he planned to watch the battle himself. 
70. When the order to sail was given, they headed towards Salamis and calmly lined up their ships. However, there wasn't enough daylight left for them to fight, as night was approaching, so they prepared for the next day. The Greeks, especially those from the Peloponnese, were filled with fear and dread. They were worried because they were stationed in Salamis and were about to fight a sea battle for the land of the Athenians. If they were defeated, they would be trapped on an island and besieged, leaving their own land unprotected. 
71. On that same night, the barbarians' land army began marching towards the Peloponnese. The Peloponnesians had tried every possible way to prevent the invasion by land. When they learned that Leonidas and his men at Thermopylae had been killed, they quickly gathered from their cities and positioned themselves at the Isthmus. Their leader was Cleombrotus, son of Anaxandrides and brother of Leonidas. Once they were in position at the Isthmus, they destroyed the Scironian road and decided to build a wall across the Isthmus. With tens of thousands of people working together, they quickly completed the task, using stones, bricks, logs, and baskets full of sand. They worked non-stop, day and night, without any rest. 
72. The Greeks who gathered at the Isthmus included the Lacedaemonians, all the Arcadians, Eleans, Corinthians, Sicyonians, Epidaurians, Phliasians, Troezenians, and Hermioneans. These were the ones who came together, concerned for the safety of Greece. The rest of the Peloponnesians didn't seem to care, even though the Olympian and Carnean festivals had already passed. 
73. Seven different groups of people live in the Peloponnese. Two of them, the Arcadians and Cynurians, have always lived there. The Achaean group has never left the Peloponnese, but they moved from their original land to another area. The other four groups, the Dorians, Aetolians, Dryopians, and Lemnians, came from other places. The Dorians have many well-known cities, the Aetolians have only Elis, the Dryopians have Hermione and Asine near Laconian Cardamyle, and the Lemnians have all the Paroreatae. The Cynurians have always lived there and are the only Ionians, but over time, they have become more like the Dorians because of Argive influence. They include the Orneatae and the perioikoi. All the other cities of these seven groups, except the ones I mentioned, stayed neutral. To be honest, by staying neutral, they sided with the Medes. 
74. The people at the Isthmus were working extremely hard, as everything they had was at risk, and they didn't believe the ships would be successful. Meanwhile, those at Salamis heard about their efforts but were still very worried, not for themselves, but for the Peloponnese. At first, they quietly discussed their concerns about Eurybiades' poor decision-making among themselves. Eventually, the issue was openly addressed in a meeting. They debated the same topics as before: some argued that they should sail to the Peloponnese and fight for that land, rather than staying and fighting for a land that had already been captured. However, the Athenians, Aeginetans, and Megarians insisted that they should stay and defend themselves. 
75. When the Peloponnesians disagreed with him, Themistocles secretly left the meeting and sent a man named Sicinnus to the Median fleet with a message. Sicinnus was Themistocles' servant and looked after his sons. Later, Themistocles helped him become a Thespian citizen and gave him money. Sicinnus went to the barbarian generals and told them, "The Athenian general sent me without the other Greeks knowing. He supports the king and wants your side to win, not the Greeks'. He told me that the Greeks are scared and planning to run away. You can achieve a great victory if you don't let them escape. They don't all agree, and they won't fight you anymore. Instead, you'll see them fighting each other, with those who support you fighting against those who don't." After delivering the message, he left. 
76. Believing the message to be true, the Persians first sent many of their soldiers to the small island of Psyttalea, located between Salamis and the mainland. At midnight, they moved their western wing in a circle towards Salamis, while those stationed at Ceos and Cynosura also set sail, filling the passage up to Munychia with their ships. They positioned their ships this way to trap the Greeks at Salamis, making them pay for the battles at Artemisium. The reason they sent Persians to the island of Psyttalea was that during the battle, most of the men and wreckage would likely wash ashore there, as the island was in the path of the upcoming fight. The Persians would be able to save some of those who washed up and kill the others. They carried out these preparations quietly during the night, without sleep, so their enemies wouldn't hear them. 
77. I can't argue that oracles aren't true, and I don't want to question them when their messages are clear. Just look at this example: "When the sacred headland of golden-sworded Artemis and Cynosura by the sea are connected by ships, after destroying shining Athens with reckless hope, divine justice will put an end to mighty greed, the child of arrogance, with a terrible desire to consume everything." "Bronze will clash with bronze, and Ares will turn the sea red with blood. The day of freedom for Greece will be brought by far-seeing Zeus and glorious Victory." Considering this, I don't dare to say anything against Bacis when it comes to oracles when he speaks so clearly, and I won't agree with anyone who does. 
78. At Salamis, the generals were having a heated debate. They were not aware that the enemy ships had surrounded them, as they still thought the enemy was in the same position they had seen them during the day. 
79. While the generals were arguing, Aristides, an Athenian and the son of Lysimachus, arrived from Aegina. Even though he had been banished by the people, I found out through my research that he was the best and most just man in Athens. Despite being enemies with Themistocles, Aristides put aside their differences due to the seriousness of the situation and called him out to talk. Aristides had already heard that the Peloponnesians wanted to sail to the Isthmus, so when Themistocles came out, he said, "At all times, and especially now, we should compete to see who can do more good for our country. It doesn't matter if the Peloponnesians talk about leaving this place, because I've seen with my own eyes that even if the Corinthians and Eurybiades wanted to, they wouldn't be able to escape. We are surrounded by the enemy. Go and tell them this." 
80. Themistocles replied, "Your encouragement is very helpful, and you bring great news. You've seen exactly what I wanted to happen. You should know that I'm the reason the Medes are doing this. Since the Greeks didn't want to fight willingly, it was necessary to force them against their will. As you've come with good news, you should tell them yourself. If I say these things, they might think I made it up, and they won't believe that the barbarians are doing this. Go in and inform them about the situation. It's best if they believe you when you tell them, but even if they find it hard to believe, it doesn't matter. They won't be able to escape if we're truly surrounded on all sides, as you say." 
81. Aristides went in and told them that he had come from Aegina and had barely managed to get past the blockade when he sailed out, as all the Greek camp was surrounded by Xerxes' ships. He urged them to get ready to defend themselves. After saying this, he left, and once again, a disagreement broke out among the generals. Most of them didn't believe the news. 
82. While the generals were still in disbelief, a ship from Tenian deserters arrived, led by Panaetius, the son of Sosimenes. They brought the whole truth to the generals. Because of this act, the Tenians were honored on the tripod at Delphi along with those who had defeated the barbarians. With this ship that deserted at Salamis and the Lemnian ship that deserted earlier at Artemisium, the Greek fleet reached its full strength of 380 ships, as it had been short by two ships. 
83. When the generals believed the Tenians' words, the Greeks got ready for the sea battle. At the break of dawn, they held a meeting with the soldiers, and Themistocles gave the best speech among the others. His whole speech focused on comparing the good and bad aspects of human nature and life. He finished his speech by encouraging them to choose the better aspects and then ordered them to board the ships. As they were getting on the ships, the ship that had gone to fetch the sons of Aeacus returned from Aegina. 
84. Then the Greeks set sail with all their ships, and as they were heading out to sea, the barbarians immediately attacked them. The rest of the Greeks started to retreat and tried to return their ships to the shore, but Ameinias, an Athenian from Pallene, charged and struck an enemy ship. When his ship got stuck and the crew couldn't free it, the others came to help Ameinias and joined the battle. The Athenians say that the sea battle started this way, but the people from Aegina say that the ship which had been sent to Aegina to fetch the sons of Aeacus was the one that started it. There is also a story that a ghostly woman appeared to them, shouting orders loud enough for the entire Greek fleet to hear, scolding them first with, "Crazy men, how long will you keep retreating?" 
85. The Phoenicians were positioned against the Athenians on the western side, towards Eleusis. The Ionians were against the Lacedaemonians on the eastern side, towards Piraeus. Some of them fought poorly, following Themistocles' instructions, but most did not. I can name many captains who captured Greek ships, but I will only mention Theomestor, son of Androdamas, and Phylacus, son of Histiaeus, both from Samos. I mention them because Theomestor was made the ruler of Samos by the Persians for his achievement, and Phylacus was recognized as a friend of the king and given a lot of land. In the Persian language, the king's friends are called "orosangae." 
86. So that's what happened with them. But most of the ships at Salamis were sunk, some by the Athenians and some by the Aeginetans. The Greeks fought in an organized line, while the barbarians were disorganized and didn't plan their actions. So, it was expected to turn out as it did. However, the barbarians were much braver that day than they had been at Euboea, because they were all afraid of Xerxes and thought that the king was watching each of them. 
87. I can't describe exactly how each of the other barbarians or Greeks fought, but this is what happened to Artemisia, which made the king respect her even more: When the king's side was in chaos, Artemisia's ship was being chased by an Athenian ship. She couldn't escape because other allied ships were blocking her way, and her ship was closest to the enemy. So, she decided to do something that actually helped her: while being chased by the Athenian ship, she attacked and sank an allied ship with a Calyndian crew and their king, Damasithymus, on board. I don't know if she had a disagreement with him earlier or if she did this on purpose, or if the Calyndian ship just happened to be in her way. But when she sank it, she was lucky to gain two benefits. The captain of the Athenian ship, seeing her attack a ship with a barbarian crew, thought that Artemisia's ship was either Greek or had switched sides to fight for them, so he left her alone and went after other ships. 
88. Artemisia managed to escape and avoid destruction, and her actions actually gained her even more respect from King Xerxes. It is said that the king, while watching the battle, saw her ship attack the other one, and someone nearby said, "Master, do you see how well Artemisia is fighting and how she has sunk an enemy ship?" When he asked if it was really Artemisia's doing, they confirmed it, recognizing her ship's markings, and they thought the destroyed ship was an enemy. As I mentioned, all of this brought her good fortune, and also, no one from the Calyndian ship survived to accuse her. It is said that Xerxes responded to the news by saying, "My men have become women, and my women men." That's what they say Xerxes said. 
89. In this battle, the general Ariabignes, son of Darius and brother of Xerxes, died. Many other famous Persians, Medes, and allies also died, but only a few Greeks, as they knew how to swim. Those whose ships were sunk swam to Salamis, unless they were killed in the fight, while many of the barbarians drowned in the sea because they couldn't swim. Most of the ships were sunk when the ones in front started to flee, and those in the back, trying to move forward to show their skills to the king, crashed into their own side's fleeing ships. 
90. During this chaos, some Phoenicians whose ships had been destroyed went to the king and accused the Ionians of treason, claiming that they were responsible for the lost ships. However, the Ionian generals were not executed, and the Phoenicians who accused them were punished, as I will explain. While they were talking, a Samothracian ship attacked an Attic ship. The Attic ship sank, and an Aeginetan ship came and sank the Samothracian ship. But the Samothracians, skilled in throwing javelins, knocked the fighters off the ship that had sunk theirs and took control of it. This saved the Ionians. Xerxes, very upset, blamed everyone. When he saw the Ionians performing this great action, he turned to the Phoenicians and ordered their heads to be cut off, so they wouldn't falsely accuse braver men. Whenever Xerxes, sitting under the mountain opposite Salamis called Aegaleos, saw one of his men do something impressive in the battle, he asked who did it, and his scribes wrote down the captain's name, his father's name, and his city. The presence of Ariaramnes, a Persian and friend of the Ionians, made the situation even worse for the Phoenicians. That's how they dealt with the Phoenicians. 
91. The barbarians were defeated and tried to escape by sailing towards Phalerum, but the Aeginetans were waiting for them in the strait and carried out impressive actions. The Athenians destroyed the ships that either fought back or tried to run away during the chaos, while the Aeginetans targeted those sailing out of the strait. Anyone who managed to escape the Athenians ended up facing the Aeginetans. 
92. While Themistocles was chasing a ship, his ship met with Polycritus', an Aeginetan and son of Crius. Polycritus had attacked a Sidonian ship, which had previously captured an Aeginetan ship that was on watch near Sciathus. On that ship was Pytheas, son of Ischenous, who was admired by the Persians for his bravery even when severely wounded. They kept him on their ship. Now, the Sidonian ship carrying Pytheas and the Persians was captured, and Pytheas returned safely to Aegina. When Polycritus saw the Attic ship, he recognized it by the flagship's marking and shouted at Themistocles, making fun of him and blaming him for the Aeginetans siding with the Medes. After attacking an enemy ship, Polycritus threw these insults at Themistocles. The barbarians with undamaged ships fled and reached Phalerum, protected by the land army. 
93. In this battle, the Aeginetans were considered the bravest among the Greeks, followed by the Athenians. The most courageous individuals were Polycritus from Aegina and Athenians Eumenes of Anagyrus and Aminias of Pallene, who chased Artemisia. If Aminias had known she was on that ship, he wouldn't have stopped until he either captured it or was captured himself. The Athenian captains were given such orders, and a reward of ten thousand drachmas was offered to anyone who captured her alive, as they were upset that a woman waged war against Athens. However, as mentioned earlier, she escaped, and the others with surviving ships also reached Phalerum. 
94. The Athenians claim that during the battle, the Corinthian general Adeimantus, overwhelmed by fear and confusion, raised his sails and fled. Seeing their flagship retreat, the Corinthians followed suit. However, as they were fleeing past the sacred area of Athena Sciras on Salamis, a mysterious boat appeared, seemingly sent by divine intervention. The boat approached the Corinthians, who were unaware of the fleet's situation. The people on the boat told Adeimantus that he had abandoned the Greeks, but they were actually winning the battle and their prayers for victory were being answered. Adeimantus didn't believe them, so they offered to be taken as hostages and killed if the Greeks were not found to be winning. Convinced, Adeimantus and the others turned their ships around and returned to the fleet, but the battle was already over. The Athenians spread this story about the Corinthians, but the Corinthians themselves strongly disagree and believe they were among the bravest in the battle. The rest of Greece supports their claim. 
95. Aristides, son of Lysimachus, an Athenian I mentioned earlier as a brave man, took action during the chaos at Salamis. He gathered many armed men who were stationed along the shore of Salamis, transported them to the island of Psyttalea, and they killed all the Persians who were on that island. 
96. After the battle, the Greeks towed as many shipwrecks as they could find to Salamis, preparing for another possible battle, thinking that the king might still use his remaining ships. A west wind had pushed many of the wrecks to a shore in Attica called Colias. This fulfilled not only the prophecies of Bacis and Musaeus about the battle but also an earlier prediction by Lysistratus, an Athenian fortune-teller, about the wrecks washing up on that shore. The meaning of this prophecy had puzzled the Greeks: "The Colian women will cook with oars." This was to happen after the king had left. 
97. When Xerxes realized the extent of the disaster, he worried that the Ionians might suggest to the Greeks, if they hadn't thought of it themselves, to sail to the Hellespont and destroy the bridges. This would leave him trapped in Europe and in danger. So, he decided to flee. To avoid being discovered by the Greeks or his own men, he tried to build a dike across to Salamis and connected Phoenician cargo ships to serve as both a bridge and a wall, making it look like he was preparing for another sea battle. Everyone who saw this assumed he was planning to stay and fight, but Mardonius, who knew the king's intentions best, was not fooled. While doing all this, Xerxes sent a messenger to Persia to report the catastrophe. 
98. While Xerxes was dealing with the situation, he sent a messenger to Persia to inform them of his current misfortune. These messengers were known to be the fastest method of communication, thanks to the Persians' clever system. It is said that for each day of the journey, there were men and horses stationed along the road, each at a day's travel distance apart. These messengers were not stopped by snow, rain, heat, or darkness and completed their assigned routes as quickly as possible. The first rider handed over the message to the second, who then passed it on to the third, and so on, similar to the Greek torch-bearers' race in honor of Hephaestus. This messenger system was called "angareion" in Persia. 
99. When the first message arrived in Susa, announcing that Xerxes had captured Athens, the Persians who were at home were overjoyed. They decorated the roads with myrtle branches, burned incense, and celebrated with feasts and festivities. However, the second message, which followed closely after the first, left them in shock. They tore their clothes, cried, and lamented non-stop, blaming Mardonius for the situation. Their distress was not so much due to the loss of their ships, but rather because they were worried about Xerxes himself. 
100. The Persians were in a difficult situation until Xerxes himself arrived and put an end to it. Mardonius, seeing that Xerxes was very upset about the sea battle and suspecting that he planned to flee from Athens, thought he would be punished for convincing the king to attack Greece. He believed it was better to risk either conquering Greece or dying honorably while pursuing a noble cause, although he hoped more for the conquest of Greece. Considering all this, he made a suggestion: "My king, don't be sad or too upset about what has happened to us. Our fate doesn't depend on wooden ships, but on men and horses. None of our enemies believe they have achieved a great victory and will dare to face you, nor will anyone from the mainland. Those who opposed us have already paid the price. If you wish, we can attack the Peloponnese immediately, or we can wait if you prefer. Don't be discouraged, as the Greeks won't be able to escape punishment for their past and present actions and will eventually become your slaves. It's best to follow my advice, but if you decide to withdraw your army, I have another plan. Don't let the Persians become a laughingstock for the Greeks. If you have suffered losses, it's not the Persians' fault. You can't say that we haven't done everything brave men should do. If Phoenicians, Egyptians, Cyprians, and Cilicians have failed, it's not the Persians who are responsible for this disaster. Since the Persians are not to blame, listen to me: if you decide not to stay, return home with most of your army. However, let me enslave and deliver Greece to you with 300,000 chosen soldiers from your forces." 
101. When Xerxes heard Mardonius' proposal, he felt as relieved and happy as someone in his situation could be. He told Mardonius that he would think about which of the two plans to follow. Xerxes consulted with the Persians he had called upon and decided to also seek advice from Artemisia, as she had been the only one to suggest the best course of action during their previous meeting. When Artemisia arrived, Xerxes asked everyone else, including the Persian advisors and guards, to leave. He then explained Mardonius' advice to her: either to attack the Peloponnese, as the Persians and the land army were not responsible for their defeat and were willing to prove themselves, or to let Mardonius choose 300,000 soldiers from the army to enslave Greece while Xerxes returned home with the rest of the troops. Xerxes then asked Artemisia, who had previously advised against the sea battle, to help him decide which of the two options would be best for him. 
102. When asked for her advice, Artemisia responded, "It's difficult, my king, to give you the best advice in this situation, but considering the current circumstances, I think it's best for you to return home and leave Mardonius here with the troops he wants, if he is willing and promises to do as he says. If he succeeds in conquering everything he plans to and his mission goes well, the achievement will be yours, as it will be your servants who have accomplished it. On the other hand, if things don't go as Mardonius expects, it won't be a big loss as long as you and your family are safe. As long as you and your household are safe, the Greeks will have to fight for their lives many times. If any disaster happens to Mardonius, it won't matter much, and any victory the Greeks achieve won't be a real victory if they only defeat your servant. As for you, you'll be returning home after burning Athens, which was the main goal of your expedition." 
103. Xerxes was pleased with Artemisia's advice, as it aligned with what he had been thinking. In fact, I believe that even if everyone had advised him to stay, he wouldn't have remained, as he was extremely frightened. After thanking Artemisia, he sent her to Ephesus to take care of his illegitimate sons who were with him. 
104. Xerxes sent Hermotimus along with his sons as their guardian. Hermotimus, originally from Pedasa, was the most respected eunuch in Xerxes' court. The people of Pedasa lived near Halicarnassus. Among these people, there was a belief that when something bad was about to happen to those living around their city, the priestess of Athena would grow a large beard. This had already occurred twice before. 
105. Hermotimus, from Pedasa, had taken revenge for the wrongs done to him more than anyone else we know. He was captured by enemies and sold as a slave to a man named Panionius from Chios, who made a living through terrible actions. Panionius would find good-looking boys, castrate them, and then sell them at high prices in Sardis and Ephesus, as the barbarians valued eunuchs more than unaltered men due to the trust they placed in them. Hermotimus was one of the many boys Panionius had castrated, but his fate wasn't entirely bad. He was brought to King Xerxes along with other gifts, and over time, he became the most favored eunuch in the king's court. 
106. While King Xerxes was in Sardis, preparing to lead his Persian army against Athens, Hermotimus went to Mysia, a region inhabited by Chians and known as Atarneus, for some business. There, he met Panionius, the man who had castrated him. Recognizing him, Hermotimus had a friendly conversation with Panionius, telling him that he owed his success to him and promising to make Panionius prosperous if he moved his family to live there. Panionius gladly accepted the offer and brought his wife and children. Once Hermotimus had Panionius and his family under his control, he confronted him, asking what harm he or his ancestors had done to Panionius to deserve such a cruel fate. He told Panionius that the gods were aware of his wicked deeds and had brought him to justice. Hermotimus then forced Panionius to castrate his four sons, and after that, the sons were forced to castrate their father in return. This was how Hermotimus took revenge on Panionius for the wrongs done to him. 
107. After entrusting his sons to Artemisia to be taken to Ephesus, Xerxes called Mardonius and told him to choose anyone he wanted from the army and do his best to fulfill his promises. That's how things went that day. During the night, however, the admirals, following the king's orders, sailed from Phalerum and headed back to the Hellespont as quickly as possible to protect the bridges for the king's return. As the barbarians approached the "Girdle" during their journey, they mistook some small headlands extending from the mainland for ships and fled for a considerable distance. Once they realized that these were not ships but headlands, they regrouped and continued on their way. 
108. When daylight came, the Greeks saw the land army still in its position and assumed the ships were at Phalerum. They prepared for a sea battle to defend themselves. However, when they found out that the ships had left, they immediately decided to chase Xerxes' fleet. They followed the fleet as far as Andros but couldn't catch up with it. Upon reaching Andros, they held a meeting. Themistocles suggested that they should continue chasing the ships through the islands and then head to the Hellespont to destroy the bridges. Eurybiades, however, disagreed, arguing that breaking the bridges would cause more harm to Greece. He explained that if the Persian army was trapped in Europe, they would not remain idle. If they were idle, they would neither succeed in their mission nor find a way to return home, and their army would starve. If they were active, they might conquer or make alliances with every town and nation in Europe, living off the resources of Greece. Eurybiades believed that after their defeat at sea, the Persians would not stay in Europe but would flee to their own country. He suggested that the war should be fought in their territory, not Greece. The other Peloponnesian admirals agreed with Eurybiades' opinion. 
109. When Themistocles realized that he couldn't convince the majority to sail to the Hellespont, he turned to the Athenians. They were the most upset about the Persians' escape and were willing to sail to the Hellespont even if the others wouldn't. He spoke to them, saying that he had often seen and heard of defeated men regaining their strength when cornered. He reminded them that their victory was due to a fortunate turn of events and the help of the gods and heroes. They believed that Asia and Europe were too vast for one wicked and impious man to rule, a man who had destroyed temples and disrespected the gods. Themistocles advised the Athenians to stay in Greece for now, focusing on rebuilding their homes and working on their lands, after driving the foreigners away completely. He suggested that they could sail to the Hellespont and Ionia the following spring. He said this to gain favor with the Persians, in case he ever needed a place to escape to if he faced trouble with the Athenians, which eventually did happen. 
110. Themistocles spoke with the intention to deceive, and the Athenians followed him. Since he had always been considered wise and had proven himself to be both intelligent and cautious, they were willing to listen to whatever he said. After convincing them, Themistocles immediately sent trustworthy men in a boat to deliver a message to the king, one of whom was his servant Sicinnus. When they arrived in Attica, the rest of the men stayed with the boat while Sicinnus went to Xerxes. He said, "Themistocles, son of Neocles, the Athenian general and the most valuable and wise among all the allies, has sent me to tell you this: Themistocles the Athenian, wanting to help you, has stopped the Greeks from pursuing your ships and destroying the Hellespont bridges. Now he advises you to leave without any obstacles." After delivering the message, the men returned to their boat. 
111. The Greeks, having decided not to chase the enemy ships further or sail to the Hellespont to destroy the passage, decided to attack the island of Andros to capture it. The people of Andros had refused to give money when Themistocles demanded it. Themistocles told them that the Athenians had two powerful gods on their side, Persuasion and Necessity, so the Andrians had no choice but to give money. The Andrians replied, "It's no wonder that Athens is great and prosperous, with such helpful gods. But we Andrians are only blessed with a shortage of land and two useless gods who never leave our island: Poverty and Helplessness. Since we are under the control of these gods, we won't give any money. Athens' power can never be stronger than our inability to pay." 
112. The Andrians were besieged because they refused to give what was demanded of them. Themistocles' greed knew no bounds. He used the same agents he had sent to the king to send threatening messages to other islands, demanding money. He warned that if they didn't pay, he would bring the Greek fleet to attack and capture their islands. As a result, he collected large sums of money from the Carystians and Parians. They were told that Andros was under siege for supporting the Persians and that Themistocles was the most respected general. This scared them enough to send money. There were probably other islands that also paid, but it's not certain. Despite paying, the Carystians didn't escape misfortune. The Parians, however, managed to appease Themistocles with money and avoided the attack. Themistocles then left Andros and took money from the islanders, without the knowledge of the other generals. 
113. After the sea battle, Xerxes and his troops waited for a few days before marching back to Boeotia along the same road they had come. Mardonius wanted to ensure the king's safety and believed it was not the right time for war. He thought it was better to spend the winter in Thessaly and then attack the Peloponnese in the spring. When they reached Thessaly, Mardonius selected the best soldiers from various groups to join his forces. He chose all the Persians known as Immortals, except for their general Hydarnes, who refused to leave the king's side. Mardonius also picked Persian cuirassiers, a thousand horsemen, and soldiers from the Medes, Sacae, Bactrians, and Indians, including both infantry and cavalry. He chose entire nations and also picked a few individuals from each allied group, selecting the best fighters and those who had proven their worth. The Persians, known for wearing torques and bracelets, were the largest group, followed by the Medes. Although the Medes were as numerous as the Persians, they were not as strong in battle. In total, Mardonius' forces, including the horsemen, amounted to three hundred thousand men. 
114. While Mardonius was selecting his army and Xerxes was in Thessaly, the Lacedaemonians received an oracle from Delphi. It told them to demand justice from Xerxes for the death of Leonidas and accept whatever he offered. So, the Spartans quickly sent a messenger to Xerxes. The messenger found the army still together in Thessaly and approached Xerxes, saying, "The Lacedaemonians and the Heraclidae of Sparta ask you, king of the Medes, to pay the penalty for the death of their king, whom you killed while he defended Greece." Xerxes laughed at this, and after a while, he pointed to Mardonius, who happened to be standing nearby. He said, "Here is Mardonius, who will pay the penalty to those you speak of, as they deserve." 
115. The messenger took Xerxes' response and left, while Xerxes himself quickly traveled to the Hellespont with Mardonius remaining in Thessaly. It took Xerxes 45 days to reach the crossing point, and he arrived with almost none of his army remaining. Wherever they went, they consumed the local resources. If they couldn't find any food, they would eat grass, tree bark, and leaves, leaving nothing behind due to their extreme hunger. Additionally, diseases like pestilence and dysentery spread among them, causing many deaths. Xerxes left some of the sick soldiers in the cities he passed through, instructing the locals to take care of them. Some were left in Thessaly, others in Siris of Paeonia, and some in Macedonia. When Xerxes was marching to Greece, he had left the sacred chariot of Zeus in Siris, but he couldn't retrieve it on his way back. The Paeonians had given it to the Thracians, and when Xerxes asked for it, they claimed that the horses had been stolen by hill-dwelling Thracians near the Strymon River's source. 
116. A terrible act was committed by the Thracian king of the Bisaltae and the Crestonian region. He had refused to become Xerxes' slave willingly and fled to the mountains called Rhodope. He had forbidden his sons to join the army going to Greece, but they ignored his orders. They were curious about the war and followed the Persian army. When all six of them returned unharmed, their father punished them by gouging out their eyes. 
117. This was the punishment they received. Meanwhile, the Persians traveled through Thrace to the crossing point and quickly sailed to Abydos in their ships, as the bridges had been destroyed by a storm. There, their march stopped, and they were given more food than they had during their journey. However, due to overeating and drinking different water, many of the remaining soldiers died. The survivors continued with Xerxes to Sardis. 
118. There is another story about Xerxes' journey back to Asia. When he reached Eion on the Strymon River, he didn't continue by land but instead entrusted his army to Hydarnes to lead them to the Hellespont. Xerxes himself boarded a Phoenician ship and set sail for Asia. During the voyage, a strong wind called the Strymonian stirred up the waves, making the heavily loaded ship struggle due to the many Persians on deck. Fearing for his life, Xerxes asked the ship's pilot if there was any way to survive. The pilot replied that they could only be saved if they got rid of the extra passengers. Upon hearing this, Xerxes told the Persians that their king's safety depended on them. They bowed and jumped into the sea, lightening the ship and allowing it to safely reach Asia. When Xerxes disembarked, he rewarded the pilot with a golden crown for saving his life but also beheaded him for causing the deaths of many Persians. 
119. There is another version of Xerxes' return, but I don't believe either the story of the Persians' fate or any other part of it. If the pilot had indeed spoken to Xerxes like that, I think most people would agree that the king would have ordered the Persians on deck, who were of noble blood, to go down into the ship's hold. He would have then taken an equal number of Phoenician rowers and thrown them into the sea. The truth is, as I mentioned earlier, Xerxes returned to Asia with his army by land. 
120. There is more evidence to support this, as it is known that when Xerxes returned to Abdera, he formed a friendship with its people and gifted them a golden sword and a decorated tiara. The people of Abdera claim (though I don't believe them) that it was here where Xerxes first felt safe during his retreat from Athens and loosened his belt. Abdera is closer to the Hellespont than the Strymon and Eion, where they say he boarded a ship. 
121. As for the Greeks, they couldn't capture Andros, so they went to Carystus. After destroying it, they returned to Salamis. First, they dedicated three Phoenician triremes to the gods as offerings. One was placed at the Isthmus, where it remained until my time, the second at Sunium, and the third at Salamis in honor of Ajax. Then, they divided the spoils and sent a portion to Delphi. From this, a twelve-cubit tall statue of a man was made, holding a ship's figurehead in his hand. This statue stood in the same place as the golden statue of Alexander the Macedonian. 
122. After sending the offerings to Delphi, the Greeks asked the god on behalf of their country if the offerings were sufficient and if he was satisfied. The god replied that he was content with the offerings from all other Greeks, but not from the Aeginetans. He demanded a victory prize from them for the sea battle of Salamis. When the Aeginetans heard this, they dedicated three golden stars mounted on a bronze mast, placed in the corner closest to Croesus' bowl. 
123. After dividing the spoils, the Greeks sailed to the Isthmus to award a prize for the most outstanding performance in the war. When the admirals gathered at Poseidon's altar to vote for the first and second place, each of them voted for themselves, believing they had done the best job. However, most of them agreed that Themistocles deserved the second place. As a result, each admiral received only one vote, while Themistocles had significantly more votes for the second place. 
124. The Greeks couldn't agree on who should receive the prize due to jealousy, so they all returned to their own places without deciding. Despite this, Themistocles was praised and considered the wisest man among the Greeks. Since he didn't receive the recognition he deserved at Salamis, he went to Lacedaemon to be honored there. The Lacedaemonians warmly welcomed him and praised him highly. They gave Eurybiades an olive crown for his excellence and another one to Themistocles for his wisdom and cleverness. They also presented him with the finest chariot in Sparta and, with many compliments, sent him home accompanied by the three hundred elite Spartan warriors called Knights, who escorted him to the borders of Tegea. Themistocles was the only person we know of who received this special escort from the Spartans. 
125. When Themistocles returned to Athens from Lacedaemon, Timodemus of Aphidnae, one of his enemies but not a significant person, was filled with jealousy. He bitterly told Themistocles that the honors he received from the Lacedaemonians were for Athens, not for him personally. Timodemus kept saying this until Themistocles responded, "The truth is, if I were from Belbina, the Spartans wouldn't have honored me like this, and neither would they have honored you, even though you're from Athens." And that was the end of that matter. 
126. Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, was already a well-known figure among the Persians and became even more prominent due to the events in Plataea. He escorted King Xerxes with sixty thousand chosen soldiers from Mardonius' army to the passage leading to Asia. Once Xerxes was in Asia and Artabazus was returning near Pallene, he found that the people of Potidaea had revolted. Mardonius was spending the winter in Thessaly and Macedonia, not in a hurry to join the rest of his army. Artabazus believed it was right to enslave the people of Potidaea, who had openly rebelled against the barbarians after the king had passed by their town and the Persian fleet had fled from Salamis. The rest of the people in Pallene had also revolted. 
127. Artabazus then began to attack Potidaea, and suspecting that Olynthus was also planning to rebel against the king, he attacked it as well. Olynthus was inhabited by Bottiaeans who had been forced out of the Thermaic Gulf by the Macedonians. After capturing Olynthus, Artabazus took the people to a lake, killed them, and handed over the city to Critobulus of Torone and the Chalcidian people. This is how the Chalcidians took control of Olynthus. 
128. After capturing Olynthus, Artabazus quickly turned his attention to Potidaea. He was helped by Timoxenus, the general of the Scionaeans, who agreed to betray the city. It's unclear how their agreement was made, as there's no information about it. However, the outcome was as follows: whenever Timoxenus or Artabazus wanted to send a letter to each other, they would wrap it around an arrow's shaft, attach feathers to the letter, and shoot it to a prearranged location. Timoxenus' plan to betray Potidaea was discovered when Artabazus accidentally shot an arrow that missed the agreed-upon spot and hit a man from Potidaea in the shoulder. A crowd quickly gathered around the injured man, which often happens in war. They took the arrow, found the letter, and brought it to their generals, who were also joined by their allies from Pallene. The generals read the letter and realized who the traitor was. However, they decided not to accuse Timoxenus of treason for the sake of Scione, fearing that the people of Scione would be labeled as traitors in the future. 
129. Timoxenus' betrayal was exposed in this way. Meanwhile, Artabazus had been attacking Potidaea for three months when an unusually long low tide occurred, turning the sea into marshland. Seeing this, the foreign soldiers decided to cross over to Pallene. However, after covering two-fifths of the distance, a massive high tide suddenly came in, which the locals claimed was higher than any previous tide. Some soldiers who couldn't swim drowned, while others were killed by Potidaeans who attacked them in boats. The Potidaeans believed that the high tide and the Persian disaster were caused by the Persians' earlier desecration of Poseidon's temple and statue located just outside the city. The Potidaeans' explanation seems plausible. Artabazus led the surviving soldiers to join Mardonius in Thessaly. This is what happened to the men who had escorted the king. 
130. The remaining ships of Xerxes' fleet, after escaping from Salamis and transporting the king and his army from the Chersonese to Abydos, spent the winter in Cyme. At the beginning of spring, they gathered at Samos, where some ships had also spent the winter. Most of their soldiers were Persians and Medes. Mardontes, son of Bagaeus, and Artayntes, son of Artachaees, became their admirals, with Artayntes also appointing his nephew Ithamitres as a commander. Due to their previous defeat, they didn't venture further west into the sea, nor did anyone demand that they should. Instead, they stayed near Samos to prevent a rebellion in Ionia. Their fleet, including Ionian and other ships, totaled three hundred. They didn't think the Greeks would come to Ionia, assuming they would be satisfied with defending their own land. This belief was based on the fact that the Greeks hadn't chased them after their escape from Salamis and seemed happy to be rid of them. The Persians felt defeated at sea but believed Mardonius would easily succeed on land. So, they stayed at Samos, planning to cause damage to their enemies and waiting for news about Mardonius' progress. 
131. As spring arrived and Mardonius was in Thessaly, the Greeks were motivated to take action. They hadn't yet gathered their army, but their fleet of 110 ships assembled in Aegina. The general and admiral of the fleet was Leutychides, son of Menares, who belonged to a long line of Spartan royalty tracing back to Heracles' son, Hyllus. However, the first seven names after Leutychides in this lineage were not kings of Sparta. The Athenian general was Xanthippus, son of Ariphron. 
132. When all the ships gathered in Aegina, messengers from the Ionians arrived at the Greek camp. These messengers had previously gone to Sparta to ask the Lacedaemonians to free Ionia. One of them was Herodotus, son of Basileides. Initially, there were seven of them who had plotted to kill Strattis, the tyrant of Chios. However, when their plan was exposed, the remaining six secretly left Chios, went to Sparta, and now came to Aegina, urging the Greeks to sail to Ionia. The Greeks agreed to take them as far as Delos, but they were hesitant because they were unfamiliar with the area and feared armed forces were everywhere. They also believed that Samos was as far away as the Pillars of Heracles. As a result, the barbarians were too discouraged to sail further west than Samos, while the Greeks, due to the Chians' request, dared not go further east than Delos. Fear kept a considerable distance between the two sides. 
133. The Greeks sailed to Delos, while Mardonius spent the winter in Thessaly. From there, he sent a man named Mys from Europus to consult various oracles. It's unclear what specific information Mardonius wanted from the oracles, as no one has mentioned it. However, it's likely that he sent Mys to inquire about his current situation and nothing else. 
134. Mys is known to have visited Lebadea and bribed a local to enter the cave of Trophonius. He also went to the oracle at Abae in Phocis. First, he went to Thebes, where he consulted the Ismenian Apollo through sacrifice, similar to the method used at Olympia. Additionally, he bribed a non-Theban to sleep in the shrine of Amphiaraus to seek a prophecy. Thebans are not allowed to seek prophecies there because Amphiaraus, through an oracle, asked them to choose between having him as a prophet or an ally. They chose him as an ally, so no Theban is permitted to sleep in that place to receive a prophecy. 
135. According to the Thebans, a surprising event occurred during Mys' journey to various oracles. He visited the temple of Ptoan Apollo, which is called Ptoum and belongs to the Thebans. It is located near a hill, close to Lake Copais and the town of Acraephia. When Mys entered the temple with three local men chosen to record the oracle's responses, the diviner unexpectedly began speaking in a foreign language. The Thebans were amazed to hear a different language instead of Greek and didn't understand what was happening. However, Mys quickly took the tablet from them and wrote down the oracle's words, explaining that they were spoken in Carian. After recording everything, he returned to Thessaly. 
136. Mardonius read the messages from the oracles and decided to send a messenger, Alexander, a Macedonian and son of Amyntas, to Athens. He chose Alexander for two reasons: first, because he had a connection to the Persians through his sister Gygaea, who married a Persian named Bubares and had a son named Amyntas; second, because Alexander was known to be a supporter and benefactor of the Athenians. Mardonius believed that by winning over the Athenians, who were known to be numerous and brave, he could gain control of the seas. He had heard that they played a significant role in the Persians' previous naval defeats. If he could secure their alliance, he thought he would easily dominate the seas, which would indeed be true. Mardonius already considered himself to be much stronger on land, so he believed that with the Athenians on his side, he would have the advantage over the Greeks. This plan aligned with the advice given by the oracles, which suggested making the Athenians his allies. Following this guidance, he sent Alexander as his messenger. 
137. Alexander was a descendant of Perdiccas, who became the ruler of Macedonia through the following story. Three brothers from the Temenus family, Gauanes, Aeropus, and Perdiccas, were exiled from Argos and went to Illyria. From there, they traveled to the Macedonian highlands and arrived at the town of Lebaea. They worked as servants in the king's household, with one brother taking care of horses, another looking after oxen, and the youngest, Perdiccas, tending to smaller animals. In those days, even royal families didn't have much wealth, so the king's wife cooked for the servants. Whenever she baked bread, Perdiccas' loaf would always double in size. She told her husband about this, and he believed it was a sign of something significant. He called the brothers and told them to leave his land. They agreed but asked for their wages first. The king, in a foolish moment, pointed to the sunlight coming through the smoke vent and said that was their payment. Gauanes and Aeropus were shocked, but young Perdiccas cleverly replied, "We accept what you give, O king." He then used a knife to draw a circle around the sunlight on the floor, gathered the sunlight into his garment three times, and left with his companions. 
138. The brothers left, but someone nearby explained to the king the meaning behind the youngest brother's actions and how he had cleverly accepted the offered gift. The king became angry and sent riders to kill them. However, there was a river in the land that the descendants of these men from Argos would later honor with sacrifices for saving them. After the sons of Temenus crossed this river, it flooded, preventing the riders from following them. The brothers then settled in another part of Macedonia, near a place called the garden of Midas, son of Gordias. In this garden, roses grew naturally, each with sixty blossoms and an extraordinary fragrance. According to Macedonian legend, Silenus was captured in this garden. Above it, there is a mountain called Bermius, which is impossible to climb due to the extreme cold. From their new settlement, the brothers eventually conquered the surrounding area and later subdued the rest of Macedonia. 
139. Alexander was a descendant of Perdiccas. His family tree goes like this: Alexander's father was Amyntas, whose father was Alcetes. Alcetes' father was Aeropus, and his father was Philippus. Philippus' father was Argaeus, and his father was Perdiccas, who gained the title of lordship.
140. Alexander, son of Amyntas, had this family background. When he arrived in Athens, sent by Mardonius, he said the following: "Athenians, Mardonius has a message for you. The king has told me, 'I forgive the Athenians for their offenses against me. Mardonius, give them back their land and let them choose more if they want. Let them live under their own laws and rebuild the temples I burned if they agree to a pact with me.' Mardonius says he must follow these orders unless you stop him. He also asks why you would continue fighting the king when you can't win or resist forever. You've seen Xerxes' army and know about Mardonius' power. Even if you beat us, a bigger army will come. Don't risk losing your land and always being in danger. Make peace, especially since the king is willing. Keep your freedom and become our allies. Athenians, this is Mardonius' message. I won't mention my goodwill towards you since you already know about it. But please consider Mardonius' advice. I know you can't fight Xerxes forever. If I thought you could, I wouldn't have brought this message. The king's power is beyond human, and his reach is long. If you don't accept these generous terms, I worry about your future. You live in the heart of the war zone, and your land will be a battlefield. So, listen to Mardonius' advice, as the king is willing to forgive you and be your friend."
141. Alexander spoke these words. The Lacedaemonians, however, had learned that Alexander came to Athens to persuade them to make a deal with the enemy. Fearing the oracles' predictions that they and other Dorians would be driven out of the Peloponnese by the Medes and Athenians, they worried that the Athenians might agree to the Persian's terms. So, they quickly decided to send their own envoys. As it happened, both groups arrived at the same time. The Athenians had delayed their response, waiting for the Lacedaemonians, as they were sure they would hear about the Persian messenger's proposal. They knew the Lacedaemonians would send envoys quickly, so they purposely waited to make their intentions clear to them.
142. After Alexander finished speaking, the envoys from Sparta said, "We have been sent by the Lacedaemonians to ask you not to harm Greece by accepting the enemy's offer. It would be wrong and dishonorable for any Greek, especially for you, since you started this war and your land was the first battleground. It's unacceptable for the Greeks to face slavery because of you, the Athenians, who have always been known for granting freedom to many. We sympathize with your suffering, as you have lost two harvests and your resources have been depleted. To make up for this, the Lacedaemonians and their allies promise to provide for your women and those unable to fight for as long as the war lasts. Don't let Alexander the Macedonian persuade you with his smooth words supporting Mardonius' advice. It's his job to follow that advice since he's a tyrant and must work with other tyrants. But it's not your job if you have the right mindset, as you know that foreigners can't be trusted." These were the envoys' words.
143. The Athenians responded to Alexander, saying, "We already know that the Mede's power is much greater than ours. There's no need to remind us. However, we are determined to fight for our freedom and will defend ourselves as best we can. Don't try to convince us to make agreements with the enemy, as we won't agree. Tell Mardonius this message from the Athenians: as long as the sun follows its current path, we will never make a deal with Xerxes. We will keep fighting against him, relying on the help of the gods and heroes whose homes and treasures he disrespected and destroyed. Don't come to us again with such a proposal, and don't pretend to help us by advising us to do wrong. We don't want our friends and protectors to be harmed by the Athenians."
144. The Athenians responded to Alexander and then addressed the Spartan envoys, saying, "It's understandable that the Lacedaemonians worry about us making a deal with the enemy. But fear is not honorable, especially since we, the Athenians, would never accept any amount of gold or beautiful land to side with the Persians and enslave Greece. There are many reasons why we wouldn't do this, even if we wanted to. First, we must avenge the destruction of our gods' temples instead of making deals with the one responsible. Also, we share a common bond with all Greeks through our blood, language, religious practices, and way of life. It wouldn't be right for the Athenians to betray these connections. Please understand that as long as one Athenian remains alive, we will never make an agreement with Xerxes. We appreciate your concern for our well-being and your offer to support our families during these difficult times. Your kindness is overwhelming, but we will manage on our own and not burden you. Now, we must act quickly. We believe the enemy will attack soon after learning that we won't comply with their demands. So, before they invade Attica, let's march into Boeotia first." After hearing the Athenians' response, the envoys returned to Sparta.
