1. The Lacedaemonians' words were not well-received by most of their allies. While the others remained silent, Socles, a Corinthian, spoke up: "It seems the world has turned upside down now that you, Lacedaemonians, are trying to destroy democracy and bring back tyranny to the cities, which is the most unjust and cruel thing on earth. If you think it's good for cities to be ruled by tyrants, establish one in your own city first, then try to do the same for others. However, you, who have never experienced tyranny and take great care to prevent it in Sparta, are treating your allies unfairly. If you had experienced tyranny like we have, you would be more cautious in your advice." 
2. The Corinthian state was organized in a way I will describe. There was an oligarchy, and a group of men called the Bacchiadae ruled the city, marrying within their own circle. One of them, Amphion, had a disabled daughter named Labda. Since none of the Bacchiadae would marry her, she married Eetion, son of Echecrates, from the village of Petra. When Eetion couldn't have children with Labda or any other wife, he went to Delphi to ask about having children. As soon as he entered, the Pythian priestess gave him an oracle that was somehow revealed to the Bacchiadae. They didn't understand the earlier oracle sent to Corinth, which had the same meaning as Eetion's oracle. When they heard Eetion's oracle, they understood it immediately and recognized its similarity to the earlier one. Now understanding both oracles, they kept quiet but planned to kill Eetion's child. When Labda gave birth, they sent ten men from their clan to Petra to kill the child. These men went to Eetion's house and asked for the child. Labda, unaware of their intentions and thinking they wanted to see the baby out of affection for its father, brought it to them. They had planned to kill the child by having the first man who received it smash it to the ground. However, when Labda handed the child over, it smiled at the man who took it, and he couldn't bring himself to kill it. Filled with pity, he passed it to the next man, and so on, until all ten men had held the child but none had killed it. They returned the child to its mother and left, arguing among themselves about who was to blame for not killing the child. Eventually, they decided to go back in and all participate in the killing. However, fate had decreed that Eetion's child would bring trouble to Corinth, and Labda, who had overheard their conversation, hid the child in a chest to protect it. The men returned and searched the house but couldn't find the child, so they left and told their superiors that they had carried out their orders. 
3. Eetion's son grew up and was named Cypselus after the chest. When he became a man, he sought a divination and received a double-meaning oracle at Delphi. Trusting this oracle, he seized control of Corinth. Cypselus, once in power, exiled many Corinthians, took their wealth, and killed many others. After ruling for thirty years, he died and was succeeded by his son Periander, who became even more ruthless than his father after consulting with Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Miletus. Periander's rule was marked by violence and cruelty. In a single day, he stripped all the women of Corinth naked because of a message from his dead wife, Melissa. After following her instructions and sending a second message, Melissa's ghost told him where a friend's deposit was hidden. The Corinthians were surprised when they saw the Lacedaemonians sending for Hippias and were even more shocked by their words. They begged the Lacedaemonians not to establish tyranny in the cities and warned that if they tried to bring Hippias back, they would do so without the Corinthians' consent.
